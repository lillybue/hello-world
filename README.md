Hello - moms and dads who chose to give up their careers in a thriving and perhaps a not so thriving market. It's going to be ok. Yes a lot has changed in technology and you will get rejected and made to feel like you're just not smart enough and you don't belong, but don't worry because there is a place for you and everyone should be in they're place ;~)
